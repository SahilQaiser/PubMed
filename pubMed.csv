Epidemiological and Clinical Features of Salmonella Typhi Infection Among Adult Patients in Qatar: A Hospital-based Study.,30410688,We sought to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of typhoid fever in Qatar.We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients treated for typhoid fever at Hamad General Hospital and Alkhor Hospital between 2005 and 2012.The mean age of the 354 patients enrolled in the study was 28.4Â±9.3 years; 296 (83.6%) were males. There were 42, 48, 39, 44, 46, 47, 52, and 36 cases of adults with typhoid fever in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Overall, 343 (96.9%) patients had a history of travel to endemic areas. Among them, 93.0% acquired typhoid fever in the Indian subcontinent. Fever was observed in all cases, and the other predominant symptoms were abdominal pain (38.1%), diarrhea (35.6%), and headache (33.1%). Salmonella typhi, showed high resistance to ciprofloxacin (n = 163; 46.0%), and low resistance to ceftriaxone (n = 2; 0.6%). Four patients developed intestinal perforation, which was surgically repaired in two cases. Two patients (0.6%) died.Typhoid fever was frequent among immigrants to endemic areas. Travelers returning from endemic areas with suspected typhoid fever should be treated empirically with third-generation cephalosporin after obtaining appropriate cultures. Moreover, preventive measurements such as education on food and water hygiene, and effective vaccination of travelers should be practiced widely among travelers to endemic areas to reduce morbidity and mortality.
